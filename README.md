# Face_recognition

In this project, I used OpenCV and other libraries with python to recognise faces in image.

step 1:

I used pip install to install these libraries in opencv :

cmake

dlib

face_recognition

numpy

opencv-python

step 2:

You need to download the  photos , and put it in the same folder with my python file Face_Recognition. I put photos test.jpg which is the photo I want to apply face recognition on it, and face_recognition.py file which include python code for face recognition.

Step 3:

When running the code  face_recognition.py it will open the picture and draw a rectangular around all faces in test.jpg photo and labeled the recognised photo with the name of the person, and labled any not recognised faces as 'unknown'.

Step 4:
